# Zomato_data_analysis
This project provides an exploratory analysis of Zomato restaurant data to extract meaningful insights about the dining preferences and service patterns in different regions. Through visualizations and statistics, we aim to understand how features like online ordering, restaurant types, and user engagement (votes) relate to restaurant ratings.
